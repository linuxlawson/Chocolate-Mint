## Chocolate Mint (theme for Linux Mint 20.3)

Updated to work on Linux Mint 20.3 (Una)

Menu, Panel, and Calender only (cinnamon.css).  
Does not include Windows Borders or Controls.  


To use:

1. Make a copy of a theme found in usr/share/themes. (i used Mint-Y-Dark so that would be a good choice).

2. Go to your home folder and under view on the menu click "show hidden folders" and look for .themes folder.

3. If .themes doesnt exist, create it. Right click >> Create New Folder, >> type .themes

4. Paste the theme you copied into the .themes folder.     

If you have to create a .themes folder, it should have a period in front of it >> .themes

5. Replace the cinnamon.css in your copy of Mint-Y-Dark with cinnamon.css found above.  

4. Rename new copy to Chocolate Mint (or whatever..)

It should now show up in your themes under: System Settings >> Themes >> Desktop  

Enjoy.
